    <h1>THE WIZARD AND THE HOPPING POT</h1>
    <p>
        This story was about the legacy of an old wizard who, in his generosity, uses his magic to aid the Muggles of his village. Rather than admit he is a wizard, he disguises his magic by pretending to brew wondrous medicines in an old cauldron. On his death, he leaves all his belongings to his only son, who has none of his father's generosity or sympathy towards non-Wizards, and nowhere near his skill at magic. After his father's death, the son finds the pot and a single slipper inside it, together with a note from his father that reads, "In the fond hope, my son, that you will never need this".
<p>
    Bitter for having been left nothing but a pot, and for despising Muggles, the son closes the door on every person who asks for his help. The first one seeking for his aid is an old woman whose granddaughter is plagued with warts. Closing the door on the old woman, the son hears a clacking in the kitchen and sees his pot has grown a foot and a bad case of warts.

<p>
    The next one to look for his aid is an old man, whose donkey is lost and cannot go without it to the market to fetch food for his starving family. The son closes the door on him too, and the pot starts making sounds like a donkey.

</p>
<p>
    A young woman comes sobbing to the door, hoping for a cure for her sick baby. Again, the son ignores her pleas and shuts the door on her. A few more similar incidents take place, until the son finally gives up and calls all the neighbours to offer them help. As the people's troubles fade away, the pot empties, until at last out pops the mysterious slipper â€” one that perfectly fits the foot of the now-quiet pot, and together the two walk off into the sunset.
